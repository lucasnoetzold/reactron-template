Working template for using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) in an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app. Feel free to use!

To start in development mode:

```
npm start
```

To build it for production:

```
npm run build
```

The result will be in the `dist` folder.

If you need any help to tweak it, [e-mail me](mailto:inoitso@gmail.com), I'll answer if I have the time.
